## IOT Weather Station

For our junior design project, we have built a weather station that operates outdoors and measures temperature, barometric pressure, ultraviolet radiation levels, humidity, wind direction, and wind speed. The data is transmitted wirelessly to the ThingSpeak website. Additionally, the weather station has an LCD for current readings viewing. The report included describes the progress of the design, construction of the weather station along with the master code file, and enclosure box for the electrical systems. The included report expands on the results, difficulties, and design changes during the development process.
