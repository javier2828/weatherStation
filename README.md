## IOT Weather Station

For the Junior Design project, we have built a weather station that operates outdoors and measures temperature, barometric pressure, ultraviolet radiation levels, humidity, wind direction, and wind speed. The data is transmitted wirelessly to the ThingSpeak website. Additionally, the weather station has an LCD for current readings viewing. This report describes the progress of the design and construction of the weather station since the second report. After the second report, we updated the master code file and developed the case for the electrical systems. This report expands on the results, difficulties, and design changes during the ongoing development process.
